# static-boilerplate

This repository provides a simple starting point for frontend-centered development.
You'll get a minimal project built with Foundation and SASS.  There is also
a lightweight dev server (running in NodeJS) which supports livereload and SASS rebuilds.
Gulp provides tasks for distribution (with minification and concatenation) and deployment.

## Installation

You may need to install gulp globally

```shell
npm install -g gulp
```

Load dependencies for project and dev server

```shell
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

Check for available tasks

```shell
$ gulp help
```

Run

```shell
$ gulp
```

to start the dev server.
