[ ![Codeship Status for abits/static-boilerplate](https://codeship.com/projects/a58e7a60-667a-0132-9587-66851841475d/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/52850)

This repository provides a simple starting point for frontend-centered development.
You'll get a minimal project built with Foundation and SASS.  There is also
a lightweight dev server (running in NodeJS) which supports livereload and SASS rebuilds.
Gulp provides tasks for distribution (with minification and concatenation) and deployment.

## Installation

You may need to install gulp globally

```shell
npm install -g gulp
```

Load dependencies for project and dev server

```shell
npm install
```

Check for available tasks

```shell
gulp help
```

In the *project root directory* run

```shell
gulp
```

to start the dev server.
